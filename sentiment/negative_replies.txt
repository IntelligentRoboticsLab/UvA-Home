I'm not too fond of [SUBJ].
Actually, I'd rather not talk about [SUBJ].
Every time I hear [SUBJ] I get sad.
Can't we just remove [SUBJ] from this planet.
I just want [SUBJ] to stop. Just, stop.
Shall we start a petition against [SUBJ]?
Why can't [SUBJ] just be nice?
It makes me sad.
Well, I'd rather talk about something more positive.
